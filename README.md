# BackEnd Study Repository

This repository is dedicated to storing my programming exercises and study projects. The goal is to deepen my understanding of **Java** and **Python** through classroom learning, online courses, and hands-on practice.

## Repository Structure

- **exercises/**: Contains programming exercises to reinforce fundamental concepts.
- **projects/**: Includes practical projects that apply more advanced concepts.

## Repository Rules

1. **Content**: Only include exercises and projects for study purposes. Do not add personal or commercial tasks.
2. **Organization**: Maintain a clear and consistent folder structure with separate directories.
3. **Code Quality**: Follow coding standards and add comments where necessary.
4. **History and Versioning**: Use clear commit messages and create branches for new features or additions.
5. **Testing**: Include and run unit tests whenever applicable.
6. **Security**: Do not include sensitive data. Use a proper `.gitignore` configuration.
7. **Collaboration**: Follow the contribution policy and review code as needed.
8. **Documentation**: Keep the `README.md` up to date, and provide helpful examples and tips when appropriate.

## What Is Prohibited

1. **Sensitive Information**: Never include personal data, passwords, API keys, or any confidential information in the repository.
2. **Third-Party Code**: Do not add code that is not your own or not properly licensed. If using third-party code, ensure proper attribution and that the license allows usage.
3. **Unrelated Changes**: Avoid adding tasks or projects unrelated to the goal of studying and practicing **Java** and **Python**.
4. **Unnecessary Files**: Do not include temporary files, IDE-specific configurations (like `.classpath`, `.project`, `.idea`, etc.), or files unrelated to the projectâ€™s functionality.
5. **Malicious or Inappropriate Code**: Do not add any code that is harmful, offensive, or that compromises the integrity and security of the repository.
6. **Undocumented Changes**: Significant changes must be documented properly in commits and, when needed, in the `README.md`.
